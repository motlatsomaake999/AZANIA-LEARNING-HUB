        I created <strong>Azania Learning Hub</strong> to provide free, high-quality educational materials to learners
        across Africa, regardless of their background or location. This platform is a response to the urgent need for
        accessible learning resources and aligns with the National Development Plan (NDP) 2023 goal of improving
        education.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our mission supports the NDP‚Äôs vision to ensure that all children have access to quality early education and to
        achieve <strong>90% literacy and numeracy proficiency by Grade 4</strong>. Through this initiative, I aim to
        contribute meaningfully to educational equity and excellence across the continent.
